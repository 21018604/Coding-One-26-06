Summer is the season of music, with festivals of all genres hitting the scene in droves. My favourite rock festival is no exception, it brings a feast of psychedelic rock and immerses me in the music. To promote psychedelic rock, I made an interactive poster that changes colour and shape depending on your mouse position, just like psychedelic rock full of surprises and ideas. I wanted this fun way to catch the attention of more people and make them feel the magic of psychedelic rock too.
